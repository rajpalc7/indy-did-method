## Privacy Considerations

Given that Indy is a publicly readable, immutable ledger, no personally identifiable information, including DIDs where a person is the DID Subject, should be placed on the network.

### DID Core Specification Privacy Considerations

The requirements for all DID method specifications when authoring the Privacy Considerations section are:

- The DID method specification's Privacy Considerations section MUST discuss any subsection of [Section 5 of RFC6973](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6973#section-5) that could apply in a method-specific manner. The subsections to consider are: surveillance, stored data compromise, unsolicited traffic, misattribution, correlation, identification, secondary use, disclosure, and exclusion.
    - surveillance
    - stored data compromise
    - unsolicited traffic
    - misattribution
    - correlation
    - identification
    - secondary use
    - disclosure
    - exclusion
